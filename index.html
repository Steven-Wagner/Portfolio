            <p>I'm a web developer who loves coding and solving problems. I love the challenge of learning new technologies and the satisfaction of solving a difficult problem that's been nagging at me for days.</p> 
            <p>It's awesome to be able to build pages that help users make their lives more enjoyable and more efficient, and I have developed all sorts of projects from games to time-saving recipe apps. I have a passion for creating useful content that people will enjoy.</p>
            <p>When I'm not coding, I like to mountain bike, write short stories, and play table-top games(and even try my hand at designing my own). My friends tell me I'm freakishly calm under pressure and a great leader who brings out the best in the people I work with.</p>

                <p>Get movie suggestions from people who like similar movies as you.</p>
                <p>Most current movie review sites take the average of all users or critics and try to 
                    predict the quality of the movie and the likelihood that someone will enjoy the movie, but people's tastes are eclectic and 
                    having an algorithm that is more personalized to the user will result in a better prediction of what each individual user 
                    will enjoy.
                </p> 
                <p>The goal of this app is to connect users with similar tastes so that they can receive personalized movie suggestions 
                    that will be more accurate than a traditional movie review site at determining if that user will actually enjoy the movie.
